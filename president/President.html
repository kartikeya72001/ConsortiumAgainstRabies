        <p>Dear Colleagues,</p>
        
        <p>Formation of Consortium against Rabies (CAR) was conceived and implemented In 2009 with an idea to do something different in the field of Rabies prevention especially in the Northern states of India. There has been considerable brain storming amongst the likeminded determined experts in the field so that the objectives and vision of this association are achieved & well sustained in times to come. This Journey started with 15 members under the lead & guidance of Dr. Kanan, first President of CAR and dynamism of Dr. Anurag Aggarwal, 1st Secretary General of CAR. I feel proud to announce that today we are a family of more than 160 members. These members have joined us only when they are fully convinced with the concept/objective and are determined to work for the same.</p>
        
        <p>So far, we are successful in carrying activities in 5-6 states through our annual conferences and other midterm CMEs. These annual events have the distinction of being organized in regional Medical Colleges, where we feel that sharing of updated knowledge has maximal impact in terms of benefits to the society at large.</p>
        
        <p>We have been communicating to our members through e Mail and a preliminary website (managed by Dr. Aamir M Khan) and now there is a need for CAR to expand further and a well designed interactive website is the need of the hour. I congratulate our IT experts for building this new website of CAR. The streamlined user interface provides a more interactive experience, allowing our colleagues, partners and prospects to easily find the information they are looking for. </p>
        
        <p>We hope that you enjoy the fresh look, periodic updations of this website and also find that this portal serves as a valuable resource for you in the field of Rabies and other zoonotic diseases. </p>
        <p>Long Live CAR!</p>
